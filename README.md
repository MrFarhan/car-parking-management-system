# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### SCSS Structure

# Abstracts (or utilities):

holds Sass tools, helper files, variables, functions, mixins and other config files. These files are meant to be just helpers which don’t output any CSS when compiled.

# Base:

holds the boilerplate code for the project. Including standard styles such as resets and typographic rules, which are commonly used throughout your project.

# Components (or modules):

holds all of your styles for buttons, carousels, sliders, and similar page components (think widgets). Your project will typically contain a lot of component files — as the whole site/app should be mostly composed of small modules.

# Layout:

contains all styles involved with the layout of your project. Such as styles for your header, footer, navigation and the grid system.

# Pages:

any styles specific to individual pages will sit here. For example it’s not uncommon for the home page of your site to require page specific styles that no other page receives.

# Themes:

this is likely not used in many projects. It would hold files that create project specific themes. For example if sections of your site contain alternate color schemes.

# Vendors:

contains all third party code from external libraries and frameworks — such as Normalize, Bootstrap, jQueryUI, etc. However, there is often a need to override vendor code. If this is required, its good practice to create a new folder called vendors-extensions/ and then name any files after the vendors they overwrite. The filevendors-extensions/\_bootstrap.scss would contain all your Bootstrap overrides — as editing the vendor files themselves, isn’t generally a good idea.

# Main.scss:

This file should only contain your imports!
